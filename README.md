This extension allows you to pop elements on webpages with a balloon popping sound. Made specifically to destroy certain websites that irritate the author of the extension

# Demo

The demo served by GitHub (they don't support in-repo attachments yet; **THERE ARE POPPING SOUNDS IN THE DEMO, DON'T FORGET TO UNMUTE THE DEMO**):

The demo is also in this repository, file `demo.mp4`

# Installation

* You'd need `chrome.zip` or `firefox.zip`. Either `make` them (but don't forget to `git switch --detach` to the latest version tag first!) or download them from a [GitHub release of this extension](https://github.com/megahomyak/pop_the_web/releases/latest)
* Read up on how to install custom extensions into your browser and install the extension from the corresponding `.zip` file (for Chrome you'll need to unpack it first)

# Usage

Click on the icon of the extension to toggle it. When the extension is turned on (as shown by the pin icon that's not crossed out), click on webpage elements to make them disappear with a sound of a balloon explosion

# Troubleshooting

If something's not working, try updating your browser first! If that's not working, you can contact the author in [Telegram](https://t.me/megahomyak) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/megahomyak/pop_the_web)
